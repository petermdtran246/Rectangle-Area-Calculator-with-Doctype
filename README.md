# Rectangle Area Calculator with Docstype

This Python script provides a function calculate_area_of_rectangle that calculates the area of a rectangle given its length and width. It incorporates clear comments, input validation (raising ValueError for negative inputs), error handling (try-except block), and doctests for self-testing.

## Features:

  -  Clear function with docstring: The calculate_area_of_rectangle function has a docstring explaining its purpose, parameters, return value, and examples.
  -  Input validation: Raises ValueError if the input length or width is negative.
  -  Error handling: Uses a try-except block to gracefully handle potential ValueError exceptions during input.
  -  Doctests: Includes doctests to verify the function's behavior with different inputs.
  - Concise and well-commented code: The code is concise and incorporates comments to improve readability.

## Testing:
The script includes doctests that you can run using if __name__ == "__main__": import doctest; doctest.testmod(). These doctests check the function's behavior with various inputs, including valid and invalid cases.
